        Visual inputs are the best possible inputs to humans. The famous adage, “a picture is worth a thousand words”, in our day and age, would read “a visualised and annotated scene is as good as an experience”. It is this we intend to bring to multi-disciplinary areas that we are familiar with –such as technology education and learning, health and wellness, mental wellbeing, and in general, productivity with enhanced decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        The core objective is to provide an immersive experience. When a virtual approach is taken, whether it is story-telling, education, or interaction -a visualisation, which we define, in general, as comprising characters, a context, and interactions within a given setting simulated in real-time situations and augmentations, typically resorted to enhance/supplement the setting and the context.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the context of health and wellness, patient guidance is very important, especially when the patient is under self-care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Often, they feel they lack illustrative guidance. Illustrative and interactive visual support would assist in ensuring they conform to their regimes and avoid needing NHS assistance.  Often, the elderly who live independently are unable to socialise due to their restricted movement either physically or due to the weather (especially winters). They crave to be able to socialise. There is substantial evidence that socialising or even interactions with their local community helps them stay cheerful and happy rather than feeling lonely and depressed.  Enabling interactions within their community and providing them with virtual activities (for e.g., a walk in the park, watching the birds, playing a game, etc.) would go a long way in elevating their moods and therefore their overall mental well-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simulations can also play a role as a therapist to help overcome phobias, in acute and complex forms, with step by step guidance for all ages,and work with isolation in hospital social spaces. AI systems can monitor the statusand provide a channel for multipleuser communications.

                As an application developer and a former postgraduate student of "Liverpool Hope University" with Master’s in Computer Science, I am passionate about development of smart algorithms and robotics. I developed the first full sized 3D bio inspired robot for my dissertation. The core functionality of which was to interact (voice based) with the user and the surrounding environment to perform a fixed set of tasks.

                Having experience in developing applications for the NHS, and assisting businesses in software implementation, testing and its maintenance. I wish to help develop and implement AI based VR simulations for an interactive user experience to my clients.
