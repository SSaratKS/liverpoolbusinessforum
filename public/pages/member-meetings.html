              Prior to running TAB in Liverpool, I spent over 25 years working in Corporate Banking, which has given me considerable insight into the challenges faced by Business Owners and Leaders - including those created by the Financial Services industry itself! As a result, transitioning into the Banking Consultantcy role has been remarkably simple!

              I am a licensed Thrive Programme Consultant.  Using this world beating psychological training programme I help people identify the beliefs and thinking styles that hold them back. By learning how we create our own hurdles it is simple to learn how to avoid doing so! I work either one to one or in small groups teaching people how they can change their lives and really thrive. I also offer training around mental health awareness, stress, anxiety, depression, and phobias. This is often presented in the workplace or to groups but is equally effective one to one or via Skype.
